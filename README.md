# Prework Study GUide

## Description

This application was built to serve as an initial learning point for some of the basics of learning to code. As a newcomer to this field, I built this Prework Study Guide to allow quick and easy access to some of the notes I have taken along my own journey so far. As I built this application, I learned about debugging, applying JavaScript functions, and so much more.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to learn a little bit about some of the basics of coding. Each section of this guide includes notes about it's specific topic, detailing some of the information I had trouble with and wanted to allow others easier access to. If you open the DevTools console, you will see the JavaScript running, listing each topic and choosing one for us to study at random.
